# Onboarding
First time we have a tutorial to tell use how to play. And tell us the combinations of cards that we can play.

# Visuals
The font use is a bit like computer based. And old school with an effect of old tv with scanlines.

# Interactions
We interact on switch with the button and we choose the cards in our hand that we want to play. Then with 2 different button we can choose either to play the card or to discard it.
So it is choose and click.
