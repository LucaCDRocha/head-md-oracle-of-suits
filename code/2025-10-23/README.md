# Face tracking

This folder contains face-tracking sketches using MediaPipe integrated with p5.js.

`demo/` demonstrates face tracking interactions: you can trigger a fire effect with mouth opening and change colors by blinking.

Learning: how to read face landmarks, detect simple gestures (blink, mouth open), and map them to visual effects in p5.js.

How to run:

- Open `demo/index.html` in a browser using a local server (MediaPipe often requires secure context / local server).
- Grant camera permissions when prompted.
