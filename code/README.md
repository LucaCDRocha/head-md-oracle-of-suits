# Creative Coding

This folder contains the code for the project: a collection of small p5.js sketches and experiments used during the course.

How to run

- Open any sketch folder and open `index.html` in a browser (or use a simple static server such as `python -m http.server`).
- Most sketches include a `libraries/` folder with `p5.min.js` and sometimes `p5.sound.min.js`. Some sketches also use MediaPipe.

Daily folders

- `2025-10-20/` — basic p5 sketches (bubbles, ripple, hello)
- `2025-10-21/` — experiments with arrays, modules, and simple simulations (planets, sun)
- `2025-10-22/` — hand-tracking + MediaPipe sketches (magnetic, music, pinch-template)
- `2025-10-23/` — face-tracking sketches (demo, face-template)

Purpose: keep experiments, screenshots and short notes about what was learned each day.
