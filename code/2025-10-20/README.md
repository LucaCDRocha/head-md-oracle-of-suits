# Project Structure

Today we have learned how a p5 project is structured. Each project contains an `index.html` file to launch the sketch, a `sketch.js` file with the p5.js code, a `style.css` file for styling, and sometimes additional configuration files or libraries.

With the functions 'setup()' and 'draw()', we can create dynamic and interactive graphics easily. The `setup()` function initializes the canvas and settings, while the `draw()` function continuously executes the code to render animations.
